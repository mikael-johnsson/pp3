# The Garage Sale
The Garage Sale is a trading game - the user visits a garage sale and tries to
trade up from thumbtack to the highest valuble item. There are no prices at
the garage sale, the user must figure out which items the vendors are 
most likely to be willing to trade.

The game is inspired by *The Office* episode *Garage Sale*.

## User Experience
The Garage Sale game is a quick and in some way simple game. The user chooses itself when to finish the game. The amounts of allowed visits to the vendors is infinite but aswell as getting a higher valued item the user can leave them with a lower valued item.

### How to play
The user start with an inventory of a thumbtack. They can then choose to meet a vendor to trade that item with one of the five items the vendor possesses. If the vendor find the trade acceptable, the item changes hand. Aswell does the thumbtack. Hopefully, the users new item is more valuble than the thumbtack.

Some vendors are easier to trade with than other.
