# Testing for The Garage Sale
The Garage Sale is a trading game - the user visits a garage sale and tries to
trade up from thumbtack to the highest valuble item - the telescope. There are 
no prices at the garage sale, the user must figure out which items the vendors are 
most likely to be willing to trade.

The game is inspired by *The Office* episode *Garage Sale*.
